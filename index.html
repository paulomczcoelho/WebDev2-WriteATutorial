        <h3 class="title_sub">UNDERSTANDING THE DOM (DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL)</h3>
        <h4 class="title_explain">The DOM explained in an easy way.</h4>
        <p class="title_paragraph">A lot of HTML was studied, the first tags, I learned CSS, 
            made beautiful forms, amazing buttons, responsive pages 
            and started showing everyone how amazing that is, but there 
            comes a time when you want to take a step further in your 
            learning and ask yourself : ”But how can I give movement 
            to my page? I so wanted that button, for example, to change 
            something about her!”. That's where the DOM comes in, 
            something you constantly hear about, but don't know how to 
            explain exactly what it is.
            You know those cool animations that you see around and you 
            say “Wow, I wanted to do something like this so much, but how?”, 
            they are made by manipulating the DOM (Document Object Model), 
            and this article will explain from scratch what it is and how
            to manipulate it.
        </p>
        </div>
        <div class="about_dom">
            <h1 class="about_dom_title">So what is the DOM?</h1>
            <h3 class="title_paragraph text_blue">The DOM (Document Object Model) is an interface that represents how HTML and XML documents are read by your browser. After the browser reads your HTML document, it creates an object that makes a structured representation of your document and defines ways in which this structure can be accessed. We can access and manipulate the DOM with JavaScript, it's the easiest and most used way.</h3>

        <h1 class="tutorial_title text_blue">What is the advantages of DOM?</h1>
        <h3 class="title_paragraph text_blue">
            With it you have endless possibilities, 
            you can create applications that update 
            page data without requiring an update. 
            You can also create applications that are 
            customizable by the user, change the page 
            layout without needing to update. Drag, 
            move, delete elements. That is, you have 
            infinite possibilities, thousands of 
            things you can do by manipulating the DOM, 
            just use your creativity.
        </h3>
        <div class="about_dom_advantages">

        <h3 class="title_paragraph">
            In this image we see the structure of the DOM, its tags 
            and how it is assembled by the browser. On this basis, 
            we have 4 important points that you will see a lot from 
            now on:
            **Document: **which as the name says, takes care 
            of HTML documents.
            **Elements: **are all the tags that are in HTML or XML 
            files that are transformed into elements of the DOM tree.
            Texts: It is the text that goes between the elements. 
            All content of tags.
            Attributes: It is the combination of all attributes 
            for a specific node. In this case, the attribute 
            class="hero" is pointing to the &lt p&gt element.
        </h3>
        <h1 class="tutorial_title text_blue">Manipulating the DOM</h1>
        <h3 class="title_paragraph text_blue">
            Now for the coolest part of all: manipulating the DOM. 
            First, let's create an example HTML to show how the 
            methods and events work.
        </h3>
        <img class="tutorial_img" src="img/Capturar.JPG" alt="">
        <!-- </div> -->
        <h3 class="title_paragraph text_blue margin_top">
            Very simple, now we are going to learn a little 
            about the DOM methods, it is with them that we 
            are going to take our elements and create 
            interactivity.
        </h3>

        <h1 class="tutorial_title text_blue">Methods</h1>
        <h3 class="title_paragraph text_blue">
            The DOM has many methods, they are the ones 
            that make the connection between the nodes 
            (elements) and the events, something I will 
            talk about below. I will show the most used 
            methods and what they are for too. Remembering 
            that there are several, for all types and you 
            can see them all here.
        </h3>

        <h1 class="tutorial_title text_blue">getElementById()</h1>
        <h3 class="title_paragraph text_blue">
            This method returns the element containing the name of 
            the passed ID. As the IDs must be unique, it is a very 
            useful method to get only the desired element.
        </h3>
        <img class="tutorial_img_recort" src="img/getElementById.JPG" alt="">

        <h1 class="tutorial_title text_blue">getElementsByClassName()</h1>
        <h3 class="title_paragraph text_blue">
            This method returns an HTMLCollection of all elements that contain 
            the name of the passed class.
        </h3>
        <img src="img/classByname.JPG" alt="" class="tutorial_img_recort">
        <p class="title_paragraph text_blue">
            myContainer: specific element that matches the passed selector. <br>
            .container: selector passed, if there was none it would return null.
        </p>   
        
        <h1 class="tutorial_title text_blue">getElementsByTagName()</h1>
        <h3 class="title_paragraph text_blue">
            In the same way as the above method, it also returns an HTMLCollection 
            but with one difference: this method returns all elements containing the 
            passed name tag.
        </h3>
        <img src="img/tagName.JPG" alt="" class="tutorial_img_recort">
        <p class="title_paragraph text_blue">
            buttons: specific element that matches the passed selector. <br>
            button: tag name passed.
        </p>  

        <h1 class="tutorial_title text_blue">querySelector()</h1>
        <h3 class="title_paragraph text_blue">
            Returns the first element that matches the passed CSS selector. 
            Remembering that the selector must follow the CSS syntax. 
            If it has no selector, it will return _null. _
        </h3>
        <img src="img/query.JPG" alt="" class="tutorial_img_recort">
        <p class="title_paragraph text_blue">
            resetButton: first element that matches the passed selector. <br>
            #reset: selector passed, if there was none it would return null.
        </p> 

        <h1 class="tutorial_title text_blue">querySelectorAll()</h1>
        <h3 class="title_paragraph text_blue">
            Very similar to querySelector(), but it has only one 
            difference: it returns all elements that match the 
            passed CSS selector. The selector must also follow the 
            CSS syntax, if there is none it will return null.
        </h3>
        <img src="img/queryAll.JPG" alt="" class="tutorial_img_recort">
        <p class="title_paragraph text_blue">
            myButtons: elements that match the passed selector. <br>
            #buttons: selector passed, as in this case there is no selector
            with that name, it returns null. <br> These are just 3 methods of
            DOM, there are several and some are quite used, for example
            createElement() which creates a new HTML element using the name
            of the tag to be created, the setAttribute() that you can set
            new attributes for HTML elements and many others.
